# ZHAW thesis template

This is a LaTeX template for Master theses or other reports at [Zurich University of Applied Sciences, ZHAW](https://www.zhaw.ch/).
This repository was created to relieve future students of the tedious work of thesis formatting.  Make sure that the thesis meets the specific requirements of your study program.
