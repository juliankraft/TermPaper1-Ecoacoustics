\subsection{Programming Language and Frameworks}
To build and train the deep learning model, the programming language Python was used.
The Frameworks PyTorch, Lightning are very popular and powerful tools for building deep learning models.

\subsection{Data Processing}
To load and process the the data on the fly, a custom data loader was implemented. 
The data loader reads the audio files and their corresponding labels from the dataset 
and applies the necessary transformations to the audio files.

\subsubsection{Sample Size}
The audio files are of different lengths. In order to avoid the model being biased towards 
the length of the audio files, the audio files are sampled to a fixed length. Since there is
files below the fixed length, the audio files are padded with zeros, it seems not enough to 
just sample the files and pad them if needed. This would allow bias to be introduced because
of the padding. To avoid this, the audio files are sampled to a random length between 1 and 5
seconds and then padded with zeros to the fixed length of 5 seconds.

\subsubsection{Transformation}
Before the audio files are fed into the model, they are transformed into a mel-spectrogram.
A mel-spectrogram is a visual representation of the spectrum of a sound signal.
