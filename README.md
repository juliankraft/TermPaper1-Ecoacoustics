## Accessibility of Ecoacoustics: A Deep Learning Approach to Insect Sound Classification

### Abstract

This study aims to reproduce the results of a previous research on insect sound classification using deep learning and to assess the accessibility of this technology. Usingthe InsectSet32 dataset, which contains 335 recordings of 32 insect species, a convolutional neural network (CNN) with residual blocks was developed. The model was trained using the PyTorch framework and optimized through hyperparameter tuning. The bestperforming model achieved an accuracy of 0.706 on the validation set and 0.649 on the
test set, closely aligning with the original studyâ€™s findings. This work demonstrates that, with appropriate knowledge and relatively affordable hardware, such as a regular gaming computer equipped with a GPU, non-experts can effectively utilize deep learning models for ecoacoustic applications. The study underscores the potential of combining ecoacoustics with artificial intelligence to advance biodiversity monitoring, providing a non-invasive and efficient method for large-scale environmental assessments.
