\subsection{Hyperparameter Tuning}



\subsection{Performance of the best Model}

The best performing configuration for the model was found to be the one with the following hyperparameters:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{n\_mels:} 64
    \item \textbf{n\_res\_blocks:} 4
    \item \textbf{learning\_rate:} 0.001
    \item \textbf{kernel\_size:} 5
\end{itemize}

On the test set, the model achieved an accuracy of 0.649. 
The confusion matrix for the test set is shown in Figure \ref{fig:confusion_matrix_best}.
